# Goal
The dashboard is an example focusing on sales, margins, volumes and conversions. There are two more views specifically focusing on the budget for the products and the regions.

# Results
By using dashboards, you will discover the right insights in an easy way. You can apply filters yourself and consult different graphs. By immediately having the right information available, correct decisions can be made.

# Project Duration
On average, the development of a dashboard takes 2 weeks – 2 months. The development consists of two phases:

1. Selection of KPI’s and design of the dashboard
2. Collecting data and dashboard development
